### Basic Idea:  
We have two entities namely user and files. We will store the file on the server (file handling) rather than in the database. In the database (sqlite) we will store where the file stored on the server and it was uploaded by which user. The file metadata can be used to tell more about the file that can be used to select a few files from the existing for analysis.
